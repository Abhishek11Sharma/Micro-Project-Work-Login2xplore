Description : 
This is a JsonPowerDB project. I have made this using html,css,javascript and bootstrap. I am not  using any system dependent database that is installed on my machine. I am simply connecting my application to JsonPowerDB database that is much faster and light weight to use. JsonPowerDB is not dependent on a single database property like it is only dependent on relation or key-value . Instead of this , it is supporting all the database property whether it is Mysql,MongoDB, Redis, Oracle etc. 

Release History :
I am releasing my code  on Github on 26 August,2023.
